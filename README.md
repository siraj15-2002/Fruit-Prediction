Hello everyone!
It's my first Machine Learning Project and the name of my Project is Fruit Prediction
In this project i used python librabies like numpy pandas seaborn and matplotlib for Data Manipulation ,Data Cleaning and Data Visualization
For Machine Learning Task to train the model i used sklearn library from which i get test_train_split to divide my Training and Testing Data
And also used KNN to know the best k value for my model
Feel free to guide me and correct my mistakes in this project
Thank You
